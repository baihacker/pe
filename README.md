**PE** is a C++ library designed to solve problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/recent).

## Prerequisites

To use this library, you need a C++ development environment that supports:
* C++17 or later.
* Building `x86_64` targets.

## Installation

1. **Include the Library:**
   - Place all the library files into a directory of your choice.
   - Ensure that `#include <pe.hpp>` is by adding the directory to the `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` environment variable.

2. **Configure the Library:**
   - Run **[gen_config.py](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/gen_config.py)** from the installation directory to generate **[pe_config](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/pe_config)**.
     - This script generates a static configuration file with default values. You can manually edit this file after generation.
       - `ENABLE_ASSERT`: Enable assertions for certain inputs or conditions.
       - `TRY_TO_USE_INT128`: Check if the compiler supports `int128` and enable it. Set to `0` to disable `int128` even if supported.
     - The script also automatically detects the presence of third-party libraries and sets the appropriate flags:
       - `ENABLE_EIGEN`: Use [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
       - `ENABLE_GMP`: Use [GMP](https://gmplib.org).
       - `ENABLE_FLINT`: Use [FLINT](http://www.flintlib.org).
       - `ENABLE_MPFR`: Use [MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org).
       - `ENABLE_LIBBF`: Use [libbf](https://bellard.org/libbf).
       - `ENABLE_NTL`: Use [NTL](https://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html).
       - `ENABLE_ZMQ`: Use [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/).
       - `ENABLE_PRIME_COUNT`: Use [PrimeCount](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount).
       - `ENABLE_PRIME_SIEVE`: Use [PrimeSieve](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve).
       - `ENABLE_TCMALLOC`: Use [tcmalloc](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools).
   - Manually edit **[pe_config](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/pe_config)** to add or modify configuration items as needed:
     - `ENABLE_OPENMP`: Enable [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org). The script doesn't generate the default config for OpenMP.

3. **(Optional) Generate Precompiled Header:**
   - Run `g++ -xc++-header pe.hpp` in the installation directory to create a precompiled header (`pe.hpp.gch`).
   - You may add additional compiler options if required (e.g., `g++ -xc++-header pe.hpp --std=c++17 -O3 -march=native -fopenmp`).
