It is my basic code for solving problem on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/recent" target="_blank">project euler</a>.

## Prerequirements:
* C++ dev environment that supports C++17 or above.
* The compiler suppports building x86_64 targets.

## Installation:
* Make sure "#include <pe.hpp>" work.
  * Put all the files in an installation folder (directory).
  * Add the installation folder to the environment variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH. Other approaches are also OK.
 
* Configure this library.
  * Execute **[gen_config.py](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/gen_config.py)** in the installation folder to generate **[pe_config](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/pe_config)**.
    * Static configuration. The values are always 1 in the generated config file. You can edit the values after generating the config file.
      * ENABLE_ASSERT whether to assert some inputs or conditions.
      * TRY_TO_USE_INT128 whether to check whether the compiler support int128 and use it. If it is 0, it int128 is disabled even if the compiler supports it.
    * Auto-deduced configuration for third party libraries. The script searches for the corresponding header file and set the value to 1 if found. See [Build and use pe's dependent libraries](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/libraries_on_win64.md#build-and-use-pes-dependent-libraries) for the pre-built third party binaries.
      * ENABLE_EIGEN whether to use [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library.
      * ENABLE_GMP whether to use [gmp](https://gmplib.org).
      * ENABLE_FLINT whether to use [FLINT](http://www.flintlib.org).
      * ENABLE_MPFR whether to use [mpfr](https://www.mpfr.org).
      * ENABLE_LIBBF wheter to use [libbf](https://bellard.org/libbf).
      * ENABLE_NTL whether to use [ntl](https://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html).
  * Edit the **[pe_config](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/pe_config)** by adding more configuration items manually.
    * ENABLE_OPENMP whether to use [openmp](http://www.openmp.org). It is NOT generated by the script automatically becaused it's inferred at the compiling time. You can still define it in pe_config to prevernt the library from inferring the value from the compiling environment. If it is enabled but the environment doesn't support it, a warning message will show.

* [optional, recommended] Generate precompile header "pe.hpp.gch".
  * Run "g++ -xc++-header pe.hpp" in the installation folder.
  * Add more compiling options if necessary. Usually, they are the same as the options used to build your binary. e.g. "g++ -xc++-header pe.hpp --std=c++17 -O3 -march=native -fopenmp".

## Use:
See [example.c](https://github.com/baihacker/pe/blob/master/example/example.c) for quick start.
